# Building Fairs with Dynamo
This project contains all files needed to publish the Building Fairs Dynamo Library.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, clone the repository and open the sample file in Revit. Go to Dynamo Studio and import the libraries (.dll files). With that done you can now start to change, extend or add new dynamo files to the library.
